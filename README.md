# Cryptocurrency Clustering

Use unsupervised learning model is used to fit a cryptocurrency data set using K-Means and PCA analysis. 

# Technologies
The program is written using Jupyter notebooks, for ease of code reading and code execution via code blocks. The program lays out a step-wise reporting and program execution. The code is run in a (Dev) environment with the use of the following libraries:

pandas

hvplot

Path

sklearn

# Usage

The program is ran with both K-Means and PCA analysis. Then the output of the unsupervised learning and clustering is compared.
